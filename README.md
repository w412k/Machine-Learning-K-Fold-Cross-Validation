# Machine Learning K Fold Cross Validation

This repository contains a practice exercise for implementing K-fold cross-validation in machine learning. The exercise focuses on using the iris dataset from the `sklearn` library.

## Description

K-fold cross-validation is a technique commonly used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model. It involves splitting the dataset into K subsets or "folds" and iteratively training and evaluating the model K times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining folds as the training set. This approach helps to assess the model's generalization performance and reduces the risk of overfitting.

In this exercise, you will learn how to implement K-fold cross-validation using the iris dataset from the `sklearn` library. The iris dataset is a well-known dataset often used for classification tasks. It consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers.
